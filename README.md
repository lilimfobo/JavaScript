# taskManager
Simple to-do app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

The Task Management System app is to help managed tasks that need to be completed throughout the day.

Tasks are saved using local storage so they are available for the user to go back to. 

New tasks can be added, edited and deleted.

Once a task has been completed, the user can simply strike it through.
